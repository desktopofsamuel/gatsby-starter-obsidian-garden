# Minimal Viable Product

Two questions to ask: 
"What is the most important thing we need to learn next?"
"What is the least amount of work we can do to learn that "


Example of MVP that you can adopt:
1. Landing Page Test
Test out demand of your product by setting up a landing page for the product, with clear value preposition, call for action and measure your conversion to track if it has positive result.
2. Feature Fake
Fake button of the feature redirecting to a coming soon page and alert the user when it is developed. 
3. Wizard of Oz
Fully functional feature on the outside, but manual effort from inside in order to observe and understand the process before significant effort has invested. Switch out into automation after learning enough data.
