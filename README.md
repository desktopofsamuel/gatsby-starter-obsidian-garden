## FAQ

## Read this if you are migrating from existing file vault

- Settings - Files & Links: Use [[Wikilinks]] option should be OFF
- Settings - Attachment folder path: Should be a folder named `media`, remember to update the config in `gatsby-source-filesystem` in `gatsby-config.js` if the media folder has changed.
- By default, all pages are published directly, but add frontmatter `publish: false` if you wish to hide certain notes.
